<p>Material that is exempt from classification sometimes uses symbols similar to BBFC certificates, for example an <a href="/wiki/E_certificate" title="E certificate">"E" certificate</a>. There is no legal obligation, nor a particular scheme, for labelling material that is exempt from classification.<sup id="cite_ref-60" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-60">&#91;59&#93;</a></sup> On the BBFC's online classification database, material that has been refused a classification uses an "N/A" symbol in place of a rating symbol.
